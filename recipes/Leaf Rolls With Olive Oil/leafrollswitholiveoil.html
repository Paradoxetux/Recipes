        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the filling; heat half a glass of olive oil in a wide-based pot. Roast 3 grated onions until they turn slightly colored. Then add 1.5 tablespoons of bell pistachios and continue roasting.</li>
            <li>Soak 1.5 cups of rice in lukewarm water for 5 minutes and drain it, then fry it with the onions until the rice turns transparent.
            </li>
            <li>Then add 1 tablespoon of currants, 1 teaspoon each of salt, black pepper, allspice and cinnamon and mix.</li>
            <li>Add about 1 cup of hot water and cook the stuffing over low heat for about 5 minutes and then remove from the stove.</li>
            <li>Spread the pickled vine leaves on the countertop, keeping the veined parts on top. Place a dessert spoonful of the prepared and warmed stuffing in the center of each leaf.
            </li>
            <li>Bring the edges in and work your way from the wide side to the tip.
            </li>
            <li>Wrap all the leaves tightly.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom of the wrapping pot with a few vine leaves.</li>
            <li>Arrange the wraps in rows, side by side. Slice the lemon into rings and place on top of the wraps.</li>
            <li>Cover them with a flat serving plate so that they do not open during cooking. Add 1.5 cups of hot water and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pot and cook the wraps over low heat for about 35 minutes.

            <li>Serve warm or cold according to your preference.
