        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a food processor, take all the ingredients for the filling except the spices, tomato paste, oil and minced meat and grind them. Add the parsley at the end.</li>
            <li>Add the spices, tomato paste and oil to the mixture you take from the rondo into a large bowl and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, add the minced meat and knead it well. In order for the lahmacun to be delicious, your mixture should have a viscous consistency. If it is not thick enough, you can add a little water.</li>
            <li>While your mixture is resting, start making your dough. Pour the water into a bowl, add the salt and sugar and mix well. Add flour little by little.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour to the water and knead until you get a medium-hard dough.
            </li>
            <li>When your dough reaches medium hardness, take it on the counter and knead it for at least 5 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Roll the dough into a cylinder and divide it into equal pieces. To make lahmacuns of the same size, your dough should weigh the same.</li>
            <li>Cover the equal sized pieces with a slightly damp kitchen cloth and leave them to rest for at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, turn on your oven at 250 degrees fan and turn it on top and bottom and heat it well.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle some flour on the kitchen counter and start rolling out your meringues one by one. Try to roll out your dough as thin as possible.
            </li>
            <li>Spread the lahmacun mixture on the thinly rolled dough so that it reaches the edges. Make sure that your mixture is juicy. Do not leave the edges empty.
            </li>
            <li>Place the lahmacun on greaseproof paper. Place it with the greaseproof paper on the bottom of the oven, which you have preheated to 250 degrees with a fan.
            </li>
            <li>While cooking, check the bottom of the lahmacun with a kitchen utensil like a shovel, when it is slightly burnt, you can take it out of the oven and place the other prepared lahmacuns in the oven. You can cook each lahmacun for 7-10 minutes depending on your oven performance.
            </li>
            <li>Then remove and serve hot and warm. Bon appetit!
            </li>
