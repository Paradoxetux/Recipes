        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Wrap the beef tenderloin in cling film and put it in the freezer. Leave it in the freezer for about 1-1.5 hours. Remove the meat from the freezer when it is hard enough to cut thin slices with a knife.</li>
            <li>Cut thin leaf-shaped slices with a sharp knife. Put the meat in a pot with a non-stick surface and cook with the lid closed without stirring until the water is released and absorbed again.
            </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and butter to the pot and fry. Season with salt and pepper and remove from the stove. For the sauce, heat the olive oil and butter in a sauce pot. Add tomato puree and hot water and bring to a boil. When it starts to boil, add salt, stir and remove from the stove.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a pan with a non-stick surface. Cut the pita bread into cubes, add to the pan and fry until lightly pink.</li>
            <li>Heat the sunflower oil in a pan. Prepare the peppers and quartered tomatoes by frying them in the oil.
            </li>
            <li>First spread the lightly fried pitas on the service plate. Pour the tomato sauce on it and place the fried meat on it. Melt the butter and pour it over the meat. Place yogurt, fried tomatoes and peppers on the side.
            </li>
